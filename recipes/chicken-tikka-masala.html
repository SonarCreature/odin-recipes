    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chicken pieces (chicken tikka) in a spiced sauce (masala). The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. The origins of the dish are debated, with many believing it was created by South Asian cooks in Britain. It is offered at restaurants around the world and is similar to butter chicken.</p>
    <p>Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yoghurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy sauce. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken. Chicken tikka masala is similar to butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.</p>

        <li>Combine all ingredients except chicken in a bowl and mix. Add chicken and turn well to coat.</li>
        <li>Cover with cling wrap and leave in fridge to marinate overnight (3 hours minimum).</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a non stick pan over high heat until smoking. Add half the chicken and spread out. Leave for 2 minutes or until charred. Turn each piece and cook the other side until charred – don’t worry if not cooked inside. (Note 4, also Video helpful here) Remove into bowl.</li>
        <li>Scrape out charred bits left in pan and discard. Add more oil if required and cook remaining chicken.</li>
        <li>Wipe skillet with paper towels (or do this part in a pot as you need a lid). Turn heat down to medium high.</li>
        <li>Add oil and butter. When butter is melted, add onions, ginger and salt.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring constantly to ensure it doesn’t burn, until the ginger is starting to turn golden and the onions smell sweet, about 5 – 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic and paprika, and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the Curry Sauce Spices, and cook a further 2 minutes, stirring.</li>
        <li>Add tomato passata and water, and mix. Bring to a simmer, then cover and reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Pour curry into a bowl, then use a stick blender to puree until smooth (Note 5).</li>
        <li>Return sauce to skillet. Add cream, sugar and butter. Stir to melt the butter.</li>
        <li>Add chicken, stir. Simmer for a few minutes until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Optional: Sprinkle with a pinch of extra garam masala at the end.</li>
        <li>Serve over basmati rice, sprinkled with coriander/cilantro if desired. Try this No Yeast Flatbread as a quick naan!</li>
