    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>mini potatoes</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>italian seasoning</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>green beans</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 Â°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper (optional, but I line the pan for easier cleanup).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss the sliced baby potatoes with the olive oil, Italian seasoning, kosher salt and pepper. Place in an even layer on the baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>In the same bowl, toss the green beans with the olive oil, garlic powder and kosher salt. Set aside. </li>
        <li>After the first 20 minutes of roasting is done, remove the baking sheet from the oven and turn the potatoes. Add the green beans in an even layer around the potatoes and return to the baking sheet to the oven. Roast for another 25 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft in the middle and the beans are fork tender. </li>
        <li>When the roasting is done, sprinkle the potatoes and green beans with freshly grated parmesan and chopped fresh parsley, if desired. Serve immediately. Store any leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator and eat within 4 days. </li>
    </ol>
